Stock buy/sell behavior can be explained by Keyesian Beauty Contest. It is 
also a zero sum game. The big players are the hedgies and mutual funds. 

define the simulator - (audience? hedgie? ape?)

base scenario - 

Hedgie vs Apes (stock only)


Next step - 

Hedgie vs Apes (with options)

Hedgie vs Apes & Institutions (stocks + options)


Features 
- Make a feature to track money flow. It has to go somewhere! (Thesis?)
- Switch to game engine for better display or agent support.
- Support multiple hedgies
- Stream real stock data


You could have a bunch of agents and stock orders. Then, each stock exchange could
act as individual simulator to process these demands. (TODO - build a diagram to 
illustrate the relationships) 

(per Bryan's recommendations)
decouple information between stock and agent
heterogenous behaviors of the agent (retail, hedgie and mutual funds)
